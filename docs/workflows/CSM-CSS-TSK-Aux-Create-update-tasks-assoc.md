<details><summary>Overview</summary>
<p><em>HSTrigger</em> is used both by task workflows to trigger a ticket workflow on their associated ticket, and by ticket workflows to trigger a workflow on an associated ticket â€“ for example, an action on a survey ticket might need to trigger a workflow on the associated report ticket. This workflow handles some of these triggers.</p>In the case of the <u>Trigger update CSS tasks</u> action, the <em>HSTrigger</em> is changed to <u>Update CSS tasks</u>. The latter is NOT a trigger but rather a flag: the following priority change will cause tasks to enter the <u>CSS/CNTNT[2]</u> workflow, where <em>HSTrigger</em> = <u>Update CSS tasks</u> is an enrolment condition.</p></details>  

**Type:** Ticket workflow  
**Activation:** Internal  
**Trigger:** *HSTrigger* changed  
**Key actions:** Creates ticket-related maintenance tasks; can also trigger CSS task updates

### Key steps  
1. Creates action/warning tasks after ticket creation.
2. *HSTrigger* change + task priority update. Triggers <u>CSS/CNTNT[2]</u>.  
3. Handles alignment of report's due date based on change in implementation ticket. 

### Notes  
<i><u>Trigger update CSS tasks</u> is used by a task workflow (<u>CSS3/Setup/CNTNT/PIPE/TSK: Task sequences</u>). It is necessary because a task workflow cannot trigger actions on other tasks associated to the same ticket. It is necessary to switch to a ticket workflow to achieve this.</i>
