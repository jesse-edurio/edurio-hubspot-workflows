### Some notable HubSpot limitations:

1. The <u>Go to workflow</u> action is limited to workflows of the same type: for example, a task workflow cannot jump to a ticket workflow on its associated ticket or vice versa. As there are restrictions on the actions workflows can make on associated records, any process that involves complex manipulation of both ticket and task properties will likely be impossible in a single workflow and require a 'chain' of workflows of different types.

2. HubSpot cannot pass parameters, task IDs, etc. between workflows. Getting the workflows to 'talk' to each other is a challenge when building a chain of workflows, as is triggering a workflow on a specific record.

3. Sophisticated date manipulation is not supported. The options for branching on/filtering dates are often limited and it is impossible for a workflow to set a date relative to a property (e.g. = *survey launch date* + 4 days).  
<small>Workarounds: [Calculated properties (dynamic use)](../articles/Article-How-to-circumvent-HubSpots-limitations.md#calculated-properties-dynamic-use) or Zapier</small>  
4. Inclusion of *properties* as part of text is limited to certain situations. For example, a task title can include a *property* in its title, but cannot be combined with text in branching logic on the title. HubSpot lacks any built-in text manipulation functions.  
<small>Workarounds: [State tracking properties](../articles/Article-How-to-circumvent-HubSpots-limitations.md#state-tracking-properties) or Zapier</small>    
5. HubSpot branching logic allows only one branch to run: the first that satisfies its criteria. Unlike Zapier, HubSpot lacks the ability to allow multiple branches to run in parallel, which may mean that *multiple-dropdown properties* require a 'staircase' of branching actions to parse fully.  
<small>Workarounds: ['Staircase' branching actions]()</small>  
6. Workflows can only perform <u>replace</u> or <u>append</u> actions on *multiple-dropdown properties*; there is no <u>remove</u> option. Removing one option from a list will necessitate rebuilding the list using multiple branches â€“ impractical unless the range of options is very small.  
<small>Workarounds: None</small>
